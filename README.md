# Human-in-the-Loop Decision Safety Framework
### A Whitepaper on Human-Supervised AI Decision Making

This repository contains the official whitepaper for the  
**Human-in-the-Loop Decision Safety Framework**, a safety model that ensures AI never makes fully autonomous decisions without human risk-validation.

## 📘 Overview
As AI systems gain autonomous decision-making ability, they still lack instinct, danger awareness, and real-world threat detection.  
This framework introduces a new safety architecture where:

- Humans validate AI decisions  
- Unsafe actions are blocked  
- AI receives corrective evidence  
- Hallucinations decrease  
- A new role emerges: **AI Decision Oversight Engineer™**
